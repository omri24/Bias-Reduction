--- GENERAL INFORMATION ---
For this algorithm, bias refers to the diference between the average of predictions of a NN and the real values we try to predict.
This algorithm receives as an input a 2 csv files:

exported_train = a csv that contains the outputs of a NN after passing all the training data into it. first column contains the outputs of the network and the second one contains the real values.

exported_test = a csv that contains the outputs of a NN after passing all the testing data into it. first column contains the outputs of the network and the second one contains the real values.


--- NOTES ---

Please note that this algorithm will only work for NN that have a single number as an output.
As can be seen in the example files, this bias reduction can be minor.
This algorithm is general and can be helpful for any NN that predicts with a bias.
